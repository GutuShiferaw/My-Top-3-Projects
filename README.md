# My-Top-3-Projects
## This is a selection of my three best projects.
1. The first project is a Game prediction App i made by training a machine learning Model. I worked on this project when i took my AI course, I was thinking of a way i could implement what i learnt on a real life application.I Created this App by training a Gradient Boosting Machine learning model over a huge FiFa Data set. The App is  a basic Pyhton UI made using the tkinter pyhton modlue and it predicts soccer match outcomes betweeen two teams.
